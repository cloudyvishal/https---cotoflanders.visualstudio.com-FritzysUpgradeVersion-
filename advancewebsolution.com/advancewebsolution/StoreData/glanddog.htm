<p>Our groomers are trained to carefully and gently express the anal glands when requested, to give relief to your dog.     What are the anal sacs and glands?  &quot;The anal sacs are a part of the dog's skin.  Sebaceous and sweat glands empty into each sac, secreting substances that play a role in both territory marking and social recognition.  When a dog passes a stool, muscles around the anal sacs squeeze the sacs against the stool in the anal canal and empty a few drops of a liquid.  If stools are soft, anal sacs may become impacted and their contents thick and pasty&quot; (Fogle 59).
