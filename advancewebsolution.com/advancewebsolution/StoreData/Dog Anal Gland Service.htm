<p>What are the anal sacs and glands?</p>
<p>&quot;The anal sacs are a part of the dog's skin.&nbsp; Sebaceous and sweat glands empty into each sac, secreting substances that play a role in both territory marking and social recognition.&nbsp; When a dog passes a stool, muscles around the anal sacs squeeze the sacs against the stool in the anal canal and empty a few drops of a liquid.&nbsp; If stools are soft, anal sacs may become impacted and their contents thick and pasty&quot; (Fogle 59).</p>
