Our groomers are trained to carefully and gently express the anal glands when requested, to give relief to your cat.

What are the anal sacs and glands?

The anal sacs are a part of the cats skin.  Sebaceous and sweat glands empty into each sac, secreting substances that play a role in both territory marking and social recognition.  When a cat passes a stool, muscles around the anal sacs squeeze the sacs against the stool in the anal canal and empty a few drops of a liquid.  If stools are soft, anal sacs may become impacted and their contents thick and pasty.

If the anal glands become impacted, the pet will need to be taken to a veterinarian.
