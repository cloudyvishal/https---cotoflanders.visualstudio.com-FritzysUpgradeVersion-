<p>How long has it been since you brushed your pet's teeth? &nbsp;Brushing your pet's teeth is essential to a long healthy life. &nbsp;Many studies have shown that your pet will keep its teeth later in life, have less infections, and be healthier overall with regular teeth brushing. &nbsp;We use disposable tooth brushes (unless your pet has its own) to guarantee that there is no cross contamination between pets. &nbsp;We angle the toothbrush at a 45 degree optimal position to stimulate the gums and remove the maximum amount of pre-tartar buildup. &nbsp;Your pet's teeth will be sparkling clean and your dog's breath, Fritzy Fresh!</p>
