<div class="jqDnR" id="idTextPanel">Give&nbsp; your cat the ultimate in spa treatment.&nbsp;The Fritzy&rsquo;s Pet Care Pros are gentle, yet thorough.&nbsp;We practice the lowest stress form of grooming for your cat and provide the most convenient service for you.&nbsp;In fact, the special techniques we&rsquo;ve developed for cats are now being applied to dogs!</div>
<div class="jqDnR">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="jqDnR">To start the Fritzy Fresh Spa Treatment we carefully clean your cat&rsquo;s eyes and ears, clip their nails and brush out their coat.&nbsp;Then its time for the warm water hydrotub bath.&nbsp;Using all natural shampoos, we scrub and massage, ensuring that every part of your cat has two full minutes of gentle, deep, soapy saturation.&nbsp;The warm soothing rinse is repeated to make sure that the skin is soap free and ready to dry.&nbsp;At Fritzy&rsquo;s, we hand dry every cat and NEVER use cages!&nbsp;&nbsp;We start with a good towel dry and then finish with a deep reverse blower, getting the fir and skin completely dry and blowing out as much of the undercoat as possible.&nbsp;Now we&rsquo;re ready for the finishing touches; a full brush out, some quick snips of the scissors to clean things up, a little bit of garnish and a host of special little things to bring out the smile in you and your cat.</div>
<div class="jqDnR">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="jqDnR">But we&rsquo;re not done yet.&nbsp;We document everything we&rsquo;ve done or observed, giving you a complete understanding of your cat&rsquo;s condition including any need for follow-up with a Vet.&nbsp;And finally, we leave you with updated information about your cat&rsquo;s service, health and helpful ideas for you and your cat.</div>
