<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Paws can really take a beating.&nbsp;We forget that they spend most of their time on soft surfaces like grass and carpet.&nbsp;So what happens when we take them for a walk on concrete sidewalks, hiking over rocky paths, or when their paw pads are exposed to chemicals from our floors, carpets, lawns and gardens?&nbsp;Their poor soft pads become raw or dry and cracked.</div>

<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Or maybe, it&rsquo;s just age.&nbsp;As pet&rsquo;s age, their bodies change.&nbsp;Some don&rsquo;t shed the outer layers of pad skin, leading to buildup that is prone to be torn off.&nbsp;Others stop producing the oils that keep the pad skin lubricated and it becomes dry and cracks even without wear.</div>
